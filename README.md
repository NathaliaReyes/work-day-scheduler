This is the Challenge -05 related to Third-Party APIs

## Description
This project is a dynamic calendar application designed to help users manage their workday events. It provides an hourly breakdown of a typical workday, from 9am to 5pm, allowing users to save and track events for each hour. One of the key features of this application is its color-coded event system. Events are automatically updated with different colors based on their status: past events are one color, the current event is another, and future events are a different color. This visual cue provides an intuitive and efficient way for users to understand their schedule at a glance.

## Features

1. Dynamic Date and Time Display.
2. Responsive Design.
3. Hourly Event Planning.
